## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM naming convention
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) - for IP data
- [Leafletjs](leafletjs.com) - for Map


### What I learned
Had plenty of fun doing this challenge, learned many things about javascript async/await and its behaviours. Had to use multiple APIs to complete the challenge. Definitely made me improve as a developer.

### Continued development
Although I am quite happy and proud of this project, I think I can improve the error handling a little bit more and make it cleaner.


### Useful resources

- [Async/Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) - Helped me understand the concepts behind async/await.
